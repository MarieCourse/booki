## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This experience has enabled me to:

- Acquire robust web development skills, including ensuring the validity of my code with the W3C.
- Understand the principles of the Semantic Web.
- Recognize the importance of validating code.
- Grasp the specificity in CSS, conduct in-depth analysis and slicing of design mockups, and emphasize the significance of separating HTML from CSS.

I have honed my abilities in handling HTML and CSS, aiming to create intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. 
Additionally, I've cultivated a heightened awareness of user experience, consistently seeking ways to improve the usability of the interfaces I design.
